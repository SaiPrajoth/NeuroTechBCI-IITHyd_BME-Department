#Neurophysiological Signals and Signal Processing Course

Welcome to the Neurophysiological Signals and Signal Processing Course! This comprehensive course is designed to provide you with a deep understanding of neural signals, their origins, and advanced signal processing techniques. The course is divided into two interconnected components: the Theory Course and the Lab Course. We highly recommend enrolling in both to gain a holistic understanding of the subject matter.
